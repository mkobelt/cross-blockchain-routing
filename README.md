# Cross-Blockchain Routing

This repository contains a research prototype of a cross-blockchain routing algorithm (CBRA), an algorithm leveraging a network of blockchains and blockchain interoperability solutions (BISs) to route arbitrary communication between two blockchains.

## Setup

Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

## Evaluation

To run the evaluation, execute `npm run evaluation`.
The results will be stored in CSV files in the `csv/` directory.
Please look at our paper for details about the evaluation scenario and its parameters.
